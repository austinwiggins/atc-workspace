# How to Begin Coin Collecting

Coin collecting is *extremely* fun, educating, and can also be **profitable** as well. Here is a step-by-step tutorial into how to begin becoming an expet coin collector.

### Purchasing Coins

Now that you know what kind of coins you want, you can now begin your search. Two great places to go for this are [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/). My personal favorite is Ebay.
